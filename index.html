            <p>We love pine trees! They're beautiful, strong and they smell great.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="p2">
            <p>Pines are a large and important genus of conifers in the family Pinaceae. The Plant List of the Royal
                Botanic Gardens, Kew and Missouri Botanical Garden lists 126 species of pines</p>
            <p>Pine trees were slowly dancing the tango, solo in the breeze. They occasionally and unintentionally
                gently brushed each other's needles, but that aside, stayed to themselves, swaying side to side
                leisurely. I stared at them as if I had never seen a pine tree in my life (as I do with many things),
                and can recall every detail of their appearance. </p>
            <p>The branches curved upward and were layered on top of each other, spiraling up perfectly to the pinnacle,
                long twigs sheltering them. Flat, sap-scented needles grasped onto the twigs, their spiked tips making
                them look like wet paint brushes cloaked in a smooth, emerald ink. Iâ€™ve always loved those needles.
                Since I was young, I had always loved how they looked and smelled and how they were protecting the twig
                they were on like it was their child.</p>
